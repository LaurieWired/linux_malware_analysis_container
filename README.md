# Description
Quickly build a lightweight Docker container to bundle tools for dynamic Linux malware analysis.

When dynamically analyzing malware, it is important to properly isolate the analysis environment from the host machine. To do this, you need to have a dedicated malware analysis machine. This container can be run from within your malware analysis machine to bundle and pre-install common Reverse Engineering tools. It also provides an easy mechanism to quicly reset container state for samples requiring repetitive analysis.

# Usage
![docker_linux](https://github.com/LaurieWired/linux_malware_analysis_container/assets/123765654/ac6e839a-c07a-4d4c-b567-b0edcca9a4f1)

## Running
Simply run the bash script passing the path to the file(s) you want to analyze as command line arguments:

```
linux_malware_analysis_container.sh MY_FILE_1 MY_FILE_2
```

This will build and start the Docker container and copy the target files into the container at ```/home/app```. Once built, it opens an interactive shell to the container where you can begin your analysis process. The container is based on Ubuntu meaning that standard Linux commands will work once connected. The following list contains additional suggestions of tools that may assist your reverse engineering:

- strace
- strings
- gdb
- objdump
- file

## Removing
Once you have completed your analysis, enter ```exit``` as the command. This will automatically kill and remove the container.
